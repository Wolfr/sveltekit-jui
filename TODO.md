## My feedback on Svelte kit

* Needs a title system, that can derive titles from pages to page
* Aria announcer is undocumented, needs documentation
* Needs a way to add meta tags properly per page (like in Routify metatags package)
* How do I access the object with all routes? (So I can maybe build a page tree automatically?)
