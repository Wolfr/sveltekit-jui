### Information

This project is quite nascent, but could use contributions!

Are you excited to work in Svelte Kit? Want to learn how to implement common UI patterns in Svelte?

Are you a JS dev without a lot of design knowledge but a desire to do design well? Use the components in Jungle to up your design game. Check out the [help wanted](https://github.com/Wolfr/sveltekit-jui/labels/help%20wanted) tag!

Some issues are tagged “designer”, I plan to work together with the talented visual designers in our [design team](http://mono.company/) to tackle these, as they are quite specific (branding, color and icon related).

Currently, there are some issues listed on https://github.com/Wolfr/sveltekit-jui/issues which could use some help. Especially because my Javascript game is not that strong.

### Current contributors:

* Johan Ronsse (lead)
    * + Mono team (providing UI in the background from related projects) (See https://mono.company/about/ )

### Policy

We will not tolerate any harmful conduct and aim to create a nice open source community space to work in.
