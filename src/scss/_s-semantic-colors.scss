/* Repeat color variables for semantic mapping
   For example, you can use this file to globally change the colors of primary buttons and links;
  these are usually mapped to $color-primary at the component level.

  This is in a separate file because _settings.color.scss is being used to generate documentation
  about the colors, and we technically cannot read variables that reference other variables.
